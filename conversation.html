<p class="p1">User: create node server</p>
<p class="p1">Assistant: I'll create a short TODO plan, then inspect `package.json` and `node.js` to decide next steps.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">User: (provided files `package.json` and `node.js`)</p>
<p class="p1">Assistant: I'll apply a patch that adds the server code to `node.js`, updates `package.json`, and creates `README.md`.</p>
<p class="p1">Assistant: (applied changes) Implemented simple HTTP server, added start script, README, verified server starts.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">User: i want to add two routes route one and 2 both get</p>
<p class="p1">Assistant: I'll add two GET routes to `node.js`, restart the server, and verify responses.</p>
<p class="p1">Assistant: (added `/route1` and `/route2`, updated code, restarted server and verified)</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">User: i want you to sepreate out each routers individually directly under app.get</p>
<p class="p1">Assistant: I'll update `node.js` to use Express with separate handler functions, update `package.json` dependency, install Express, then start and test the server.</p>
<p class="p1">Assistant: (converted to Express, created handlers `route1Handler`, `route2Handler`, `healthHandler`, `rootHandler`; added `express` dependency and installed it)</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">User: stop using port 3000</p>
<p class="p1">Assistant: Updated to use ephemeral port and log actual port (later user changed file to set PORT to 3001)</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">User: I'm trying to learn how blocking and non-blocking works... CPU-intensive workload in Promise still blocks?</p>
<p class="p1">Assistant: Explained that async/Promise doesn't remove CPU blocking; recommended Worker Threads, child processes, queue+workers, native addons; provided examples for worker_threads and child_process.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">User: cron jobs running on same application — will CPU intensive cron jobs block main thread?</p>
<p class="p1">Assistant: Yes — they will block; recommended offloading to worker threads/processes or separate services; provided examples and operational tips.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">User: For scheduler making many I/O requests (200 calls with 3s response) — is that CPU-intensive blocking?</p>
<p class="p1">Assistant: No — network I/O is non-blocking; but concurrency and resource limits matter; recommended concurrency limiting (p-limit), keepAlive, batching.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">User: For each API call I will do AES encrypt + RSA sign and decrypt + verify per response — will that be CPU heavy?</p>
<p class="p1">Assistant: AES is usually fast; RSA signing/verification is heavier and can block; recommended offloading to worker threads, using a thread pool (Piscina), or separate signing service/HSM.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">User: How much request is ok using AES only with three L-tier pods in k8s?</p>
<p class="p1">Assistant: No fixed number — provided a benchmark script `bench-aes.js`, explained how to measure ops/sec and estimate capacity per pod, and gave guidance on interpreting results and tuning.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">User: What happens if I keep creating worker threads without knowing CPU capacity?</p>
<p class="p1">Assistant: Warned about overload (CPU saturation, memory, context switching), recommended pool size ≈ CPU cores, using Piscina or bounded pools, monitoring and limits.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">User: how can i share this conversation with others?</p>
<p class="p1">Assistant: Suggested copy-paste, create `CONVERSATION.md` in repo, GitHub Gist, export to PDF with `pandoc`, screenshots; offered to create `CONVERSATION.md` and/or gist.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">User: export as pdf the whole chat</p>
<p class="p1">Assistant: (this file and conversion attempt will follow)</p>
